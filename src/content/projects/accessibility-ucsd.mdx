## Project Overview

What happens when accessibility becomes a collaborative learning journey rather than a compliance checklist?

Working with the UC San Diego Library Digital Experience team from 2021-2024, we transformed how an organization approaches web accessibility by creating systems that empower student employees to become accessibility advocates while delivering measurable institutional change.

The challenge was significant: our Library's public websites scored well below industry standards for education. Staff viewed accessibility improvements as technically overwhelming and potentially impossible given existing resources. Many accessibility issues had persisted for years without resolution.

Our approach centered student learning and leadership development. Through an innovative apprenticeship model, we trained diverse student employees to conduct accessibility audits, implement solutions, and develop expertise in inclusive design. This wasn't outsourcing the work to students—it was creating professional development opportunities that simultaneously built organizational capacity.

The collaboration yielded transformative results: achieving full WCAG 2.0 Level AA compliance, resolving over 241,000 accessibility issues across 370 web pages, and establishing sustainable workflows for ongoing improvement. The UC San Diego Library Student Design Team became accessibility champions, developing skills they've carried into careers at leading organizations.

<BlockQuote author="Jenn Dandle, Web Manager, UC San Diego Library">
  Doug created a framework that made accessibility improvement achievable rather than overwhelming. The student apprenticeship model meant we weren't just fixing problems—we were building expertise and creating advocates for inclusive design throughout the organization.

<BlockQuote author="2024 UC San Diego Inclusive Excellence Award Committee">
  The Digital Experience Team's collaborative efforts represent a cultural shift within the Library. They have integrated accessibility into every stage of the design process and influenced other units to adopt similar practices, driving lasting institutional change.

## Methodology & Framework

The accessibility transformation succeeded because we treated it as an organizational learning challenge rather than a technical compliance project. Here's how we approached the work:

**Apprenticeship Model for Student Development**
Rather than hiring accessibility specialists, we created pathways for students to develop expertise while contributing to meaningful institutional change. Students learned industry-standard tools like Siteimprove, conducted systematic accessibility audits, and implemented solutions across hundreds of web pages.

**Infrastructure for Transparency and Accountability** 
We established monthly reporting systems that made accessibility data visible to stakeholders across the Library. This transparency created natural accountability and helped staff understand the scope and impact of accessibility improvements.

**Systematic Process Development**
Every accessibility improvement was documented and systematized, creating replicable workflows that could persist across staff transitions. We invented processes for student engagement with accessibility fixes and established clear pathways for escalating complex issues.

**Cultural Integration**
Accessibility became embedded in existing governance structures through the Website Committee and integrated into staff training programs. We created bi-monthly themes and drop-in sessions that supported content creators in making accessibility improvements part of their regular workflow.

## Organizational Impact

The most significant transformation was cultural. When we began, accessibility seemed like an insurmountable technical challenge that required specialized expertise the Library couldn't afford. Through the apprenticeship model, accessibility became something any motivated team member could learn and contribute to.

This shift influenced practices far beyond the Digital Experience team. Other Library units began adopting similar collaborative approaches to complex challenges. The Student Design Team model proved so effective that it influenced hiring and professional development strategies across multiple departments.

The governance frameworks we established—particularly the Website Committee and Foundational Standards for Library Public Websites—created sustainable structures for ongoing improvement that persist beyond individual staff transitions.

## Project Toolbox

This project required developing expertise across multiple domains while creating systems that could be taught and transferred to others.
