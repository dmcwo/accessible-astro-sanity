## Project Overview

WI+RE began with a simple but powerful premise: learning is most compelling when learners are leaders, designers, and co-creators of their learning experiences. As co-founder, I developed the organizational structure and pedagogical framework that would allow this vision to thrive within an academic library setting. Working closely with our first cohort of learner-designers, I created a design process that centers learner needs through tools like empathy mapping, learning journey mapping, and "4 Paths" prototyping.
