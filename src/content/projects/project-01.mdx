## Project Overview

WI+RE began with a powerful question: what if learners could be the leaders, designers, and co-creators of their learning experiences?

As co-founder and Creative Team Lead from 2014-2021, I developed the organizational structure and pedagogical framework to grow WI+RE from a scrappy, DIY experiment to a lasting, campus-wide community.

Working closely with our learner-designers, I created a design process that centers learner needs through tools like empathy mapping, learning journey mapping, and "4 Paths" prototyping. I connected with library stakeholders and campus partners across disciplines to provide feedback, guidance, and subject matter expertise. 

With short tutorials and course-ready workshops, I led community and faculty outreach efforts to integrate WI+RE resources into course curricula in the humanities, sciences, and social sciences. WI+RE resources are still used today in everything from 1st-year writing to senior capstone classes. 

WI+RE's open educational resources have grown to have a global reach, and our learner-desiger alums have gone on to leadership, design, education, and creative roles at Google, Yale, Teach for America, and beyond!

<BlockQuote author="Cymfenee Dean-Phifer, Learner-Designer for UCLA Science Library">
  This is my first time in such a safe, accepting environment where I’ve had the agency to create to my heart’s content. I love the skills I’ve gained, the projects I’ve made, and the fact that everyone can contribute their thoughts and ideas to each project. I’m my own worst critic, so the anti-perfectionism value has been amazing for me and has allowed me to explore a more curious side of myself. I’m more open to trying new things, and being okay with asking for help.

<BlockQuote author="Hannah Sutherland, Instructional Design and Technology Consultant for Powell Library">
  The WI+RE way of providing empathetic feedback at all stages of a project has shown me what a gift it is to be vulnerable with your team and with your work. I no longer agonize over whether a project is “done” but instead, I consider whether it has incorporated as many voices as possible."

  WI+RE has had an incredibly positive influence on my current role post-graduation and my experiences leading up to it! The foundational UX and instructional design skill set WI+RE applies to our training and projects was exactly the type of experience I needed, and my interviewers were very impressed with the project development and impact I described. I do not think I would have been nearly as competitive an applicant for my current role without my time at WI+RE.
