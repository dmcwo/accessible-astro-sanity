I connected with library stakeholders and campus partners across disciplines to provide feedback, guidance, and subject matter expertise. \n\nWith short tutorials and course-ready workshops, I led community and faculty outreach efforts to integrate WI+RE resources into course curricula in the humanities, sciences, and social sciences. WI+RE resources are still used today in everything from 1st-year writing to senior capstone classes. \n\nWI+RE's open educational resources have grown to have a global reach, and our learner-desiger alums have gone on to leadership, design, education, and creative roles at Google, Yale, Teach for America, and beyond! \n\n\u003CBreakoutImage src=\"/projects/wire-creative-team.jpg\" alt=\"The WI+RE Creative Team at the UCLA Biomedical Library, paper prototypes in the background.\" caption=\"WI+RE Creative Team at the UCLA Biomedical Library\" captionType=\"editorial\" />\n\n## Impact\n  \u003Csection class=\"mt-64 mb-32\">\n    \u003Cdiv class=\"container\">\n      \u003Cdiv class=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-16 sm:grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2\">\n        \u003CCounter count=\"75\" title=\"Published\" sub=\"Open Educational Resources (OERs)\" />\n        \u003CCounter count=\"20\" title=\"5-Star\" sub=\"reviews on merlot.org\" />\n        \u003CCounter count=\"9346+\" title=\"Workshops\" sub=\"completed in UCLA classes\" />\n        \u003CCounter count=\"376k+\" title=\"YouTube Views\" sub=\"on YouTube\" />\n        \u003CCounter count=\"431k+\" title=\"Global\" sub=\"website visits\" />\n        \u003CCounter count=\"21\" title=\"Alumni\" sub=\"\" />\n      \u003C/div>\n    \u003C/div>\n  \u003C/section>\n\n## Project Gallery\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4 md:grid-cols-2\">\n  \u003CCaptionedImage\n    src=\"/projects/wire-website.png\"\n    alt=\"The WI+RE website: Quick and practical research and writing tutorials, collaboratively designed by students at UCLA.\"\n    width={1200}\n    height={600}\n    class=\"h-[250px] w-full rounded-lg object-cover\"\n    caption=\"The WI+RE Website is built in Jekyll and hosted on GitHub pages.

Staff viewed accessibility improvements as technically overwhelming and potentially impossible given existing resources. Many accessibility issues had persisted for years without resolution.\n\nOur approach centered student learning and leadership development. Through an innovative apprenticeship model, we trained diverse student employees to conduct accessibility audits, implement solutions, and develop expertise in inclusive design. This wasn't outsourcing the work to students—it was creating professional development opportunities that simultaneously built organizational capacity.\n\nThe collaboration yielded transformative results: achieving full WCAG 2.0 Level AA compliance, resolving over 241,000 accessibility issues across 370 web pages, and establishing sustainable workflows for ongoing improvement. The UC San Diego Library Student Design Team became accessibility champions, developing skills they've carried into careers at leading organizations.\n\n\u003CBreakoutImage src=\"/projects/accessibility-before-after.jpg\" alt=\"Before and after screenshots showing accessibility improvements to the UC San Diego Library website\" caption=\"Systematic accessibility improvements transformed user experience across the Library's digital platforms\" captionType=\"editorial\" />\n\n## Impact\n\n  \u003Csection class=\"mt-64 mb-32\">\n    \u003Cdiv class=\"container\">\n      \u003Cdiv class=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-16 sm:grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2\">\n        \u003CCounter count=\"241k+\" title=\"Accessibility Issues\" sub=\"resolved across 370 web pages\" />\n        \u003CCounter count=\"100%\" title=\"WCAG 2.0\" sub=\"Level AA compliance achieved\" />\n        \u003CCounter count=\"49→91\" title=\"Siteimprove\" sub=\"Quality Assurance score improvement\" />\n        \u003CCounter count=\"800→382\" title=\"Alt Text\" sub=\"missing image descriptions reduced\" />\n        \u003CCounter count=\"2024\" title=\"Inclusive Excellence\" sub=\"Award from UC San Diego\" />\n        \u003CCounter count=\"12+\" title=\"Student Employees\" sub=\"trained in accessibility best practices\" />\n      \u003C/div>\n    \u003C/div>\n  \u003C/section>\n\n## Project Gallery\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4 md:grid-cols-2\">\n  \u003CCaptionedImage\n    src=\"/projects/accessibility-training.png\"\n    alt=\"Student Design Team members working together on accessibility audits with laptops and documentation\"\n    width={1200}\n    height={600}\n    class=\"h-[250px] w-full rounded-lg object-cover\"\n    caption=\"Student Design Team members learned to use industry-standard tools like Siteimprove while developing expertise in WCAG guidelines and inclusive design principles.\"\n    captionType=\"editorial\"\n  />\n  \u003CCaptionedImage\n    src=\"/projects/accessibility-dashboard.png\"\n    alt=\"Siteimprove dashboard showing accessibility score improvements over time\"\n    width={1200}\n    height={600}\n    class=\"h-[250px] w-full rounded-lg object-cover\"\n    caption=\"Monthly Siteimprove reports created transparency around accessibility progress and established accountability frameworks for web content creators across the Library.\"\n    captionType=\"editorial\"\n  />\n    \u003CCaptionedImage\n    src=\"/projects/student-training-materials.png\"\n    alt=\"Training documentation and workflow diagrams for accessibility improvement processes\"\n    width={1200}\n    height={600}\n    class=\"h-[250px] w-full rounded-lg object-cover\"\n    caption=\"We developed comprehensive training materials and workflow documentation, ensuring that accessibility knowledge could be transferred sustainably across team transitions.\"\n    captionType=\"editorial\"\n  />\n  \u003CCaptionedImage\n    src=\"/projects/governance-framework.png\"\n    alt=\"Website Committee meeting with accessibility standards documentation\"\n    width={1200}\n    height={600}\n    class=\"h-[250px] w-full rounded-lg object-cover\"\n    caption=\"Establishing the Website Committee and Foundational Standards for Library Public Websites created governance structures that embedded accessibility into organizational decision-making.\"\n    captionType=\"editorial\"\n  />\n\u003C/div>\n\n## Testimonials\n\n\u003CBlockQuote author=\"Marvin Ochoa Estrada, Student Design Team Member\">\n  I learned so much about accessibility through this project.

They have integrated accessibility into every stage of the design process and influenced other units to adopt similar practices, driving lasting institutional change.\n\u003C/BlockQuote>\n\n## Methodology & Framework\n\nThe accessibility transformation succeeded because we treated it as an organizational learning challenge rather than a technical compliance project. Here's how we approached the work:\n\n**Apprenticeship Model for Student Development**\nRather than hiring accessibility specialists, we created pathways for students to develop expertise while contributing to meaningful institutional change. Students learned industry-standard tools like Siteimprove, conducted systematic accessibility audits, and implemented solutions across hundreds of web pages.\n\n**Infrastructure for Transparency and Accountability** \nWe established monthly reporting systems that made accessibility data visible to stakeholders across the Library. This transparency created natural accountability and helped staff understand the scope and impact of accessibility improvements.\n\n**Systematic Process Development**\nEvery accessibility improvement was documented and systematized, creating replicable workflows that could persist across staff transitions. We invented processes for student engagement with accessibility fixes and established clear pathways for escalating complex issues.\n\n**Cultural Integration**\nAccessibility became embedded in existing governance structures through the Website Committee and integrated into staff training programs. We created bi-monthly themes and drop-in sessions that supported content creators in making accessibility improvements part of their regular workflow.\n\n## Organizational Impact\n\nThe most significant transformation was cultural. When we began, accessibility seemed like an insurmountable technical challenge that required specialized expertise the Library couldn't afford. Through the apprenticeship model, accessibility became something any motivated team member could learn and contribute to.\n\nThis shift influenced practices far beyond the Digital Experience team. Other Library units began adopting similar collaborative approaches to complex challenges. The Student Design Team model proved so effective that it influenced hiring and professional development strategies across multiple departments.\n\nThe governance frameworks we established—particularly the Website Committee and Foundational Standards for Library Public Websites—created sustainable structures for ongoing improvement that persist beyond individual staff transitions.\n\n## Project Toolbox\n\nThis project required developing expertise across multiple domains while creating systems that could be taught and transferred to others.\n\n\u003CBadges categories={{\n  'Accessibility & Compliance': [\n    'WCAG 2.0 Level AA standards',\n    'Siteimprove platform',\n    'Screen reader testing',\n    'Color contrast analysis',\n    'Alt text optimization',\n    'Keyboard navigation testing',\n    'Focus management',\n    'ARIA labels and landmarks',\n    'Document accessibility',\n    'UC accessibility policies',\n  ],\n  'Process & Workflow Development': [\n    'Accessibility audit protocols',\n    'Student training curricula',\n    'Quality assurance workflows',\n    'Monthly reporting systems',\n    'Issue triage processes',\n    'Cross-team collaboration frameworks',\n    'Documentation standards',\n    'Accountability structures',\n    'Continuous improvement cycles',\n  ],\n   'Technical Implementation': [\n    'Cascade CMS optimization',\n    'LibGuides accessibility improvements',\n    'Content management systems',\n    'HTML/CSS remediation',\n    'Link checking and repair',\n    'Image optimization',\n    'PDF accessibility',\n    'Form accessibility',\n    'Navigation structure improvements',\n  ],\n    'Leadership & Change Management': [\n    'Apprenticeship model design',\n    'Student employee supervision',\n    'Cross-departmental partnership',\n    'Stakeholder engagement',\n    'Governance structure development',\n    'Cultural change facilitation',\n    'Professional development planning',\n    'Organizational capacity building',\n  ],\n    'Research & Strategy': [\n    'Accessibility landscape analysis',\n    'User experience research',\n    'Industry benchmarking',\n    'Impact measurement',\n    'Policy development',\n    'Best practice documentation',\n    'Strategic planning',\n  ],\n}} colorToken=\"primary\" />\n\n---\n\n**Ready to transform how your organization approaches accessibility?** This framework demonstrates that accessibility improvements can simultaneously build organizational capacity, develop talent, and create lasting cultural change.
