I connected with library stakeholders and campus partners across disciplines to provide feedback, guidance, and subject matter expertise. \n\nWith short tutorials and course-ready workshops, I led community and faculty outreach efforts to integrate WI+RE resources into course curricula in the humanities, sciences, and social sciences. WI+RE resources are still used today in everything from 1st-year writing to senior capstone classes. \n\nWI+RE's open educational resources have grown to have a global reach, and our learner-desiger alums have gone on to leadership, design, education, and creative roles at Google, Yale, Teach for America, and beyond! \n\n\u003CBreakoutImage src=\"/projects/wire-creative-team.jpg\" alt=\"The WI+RE Creative Team at the UCLA Biomedical Library, paper prototypes in the background.\" caption=\"WI+RE Creative Team at the UCLA Biomedical Library\" captionType=\"editorial\" />\n\n## Impact\n  \u003Csection class=\"mt-64 mb-32\">\n    \u003Cdiv class=\"container\">\n      \u003Cdiv class=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-16 sm:grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2\">\n        \u003CCounter count=\"75\" title=\"Published\" sub=\"Open Educational Resources (OERs)\" />\n        \u003CCounter count=\"20\" title=\"5-Star\" sub=\"reviews on merlot.org\" />\n        \u003CCounter count=\"9346+\" title=\"Workshops\" sub=\"completed in UCLA classes\" />\n        \u003CCounter count=\"376k+\" title=\"YouTube Views\" sub=\"on YouTube\" />\n        \u003CCounter count=\"431k+\" title=\"Global\" sub=\"website visits\" />\n        \u003CCounter count=\"21\" title=\"Alumni\" sub=\"\" />\n      \u003C/div>\n    \u003C/div>\n  \u003C/section>\n\n## Project Gallery\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-4 md:grid-cols-2\">\n  \u003CCaptionedImage\n    src=\"/projects/wire-website.png\"\n    alt=\"The WI+RE website: Quick and practical research and writing tutorials, collaboratively designed by students at UCLA.\"\n    width={1200}\n    height={600}\n    class=\"h-[250px] w-full rounded-lg object-cover\"\n    caption=\"The WI+RE Website is built in Jekyll and hosted on GitHub pages.
